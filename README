Look at the allelements and allpeersets files for example of starting configs

usage :   ./wgmakeconf stripcomments
                stripcomments is optional. If it is not blank/missing, all omments will be stripped out

  src       : contains 'source' w/g files (from original dump)
  split     : will contain files split from the source ones 
  local     : store the "mid" versions that are local to this server
  dst       : will contain final wg conf files for usage in /etc/wireguard
